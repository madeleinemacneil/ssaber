My personal site, a work in progress.

Big props to [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), who's [personal site](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io) heavily influenced the implementation (and of course to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which underlies both).

To run locally:
```
npm i
gatsby develop
open localhost:8000
```
