My personal site, it's a work in progress.

Big props to both [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), who's [personal site](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io) heavily influenced its implementation and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which underlies both.

To run locally:
```
npm i
gatsby develop
open localhost:8000
```
